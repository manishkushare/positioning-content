                    <p>Notice the space between them. It occursbecause of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized.I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margin or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This page is actually a space character renderedjust asit would be between two inline elements.</p>

                    <p>You can see that,even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually  rendered on the page. this may not be huge deal in the firstexampless,but....</p>

                <div class="row-back row3-col2">
                    <p>Wrong!Because,together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the avialable width, but that doesn't account for the space between.</p>
